        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio page. Here, you will find some of my best projects, showcasing my skills and creativity in web development, UI/UX design, and programming. My work ranges from simple static web pages to complex web applications using the latest technologies.</p>
        
        <h3>Project 1: Natural Water Purifier</h3>
        <p>Led a team in the development of a model utilizing solar energy and an open field to purify water. Presented the project at the National Science and Technology Fair 2018, where it received a nomination. Demonstrated a strong understanding of renewable energy systems and their application in sustainable water purification.</p>
        
        <h3>Project 2: Invisible Cloth Project</h3>
        <p>Designed and developed a Python project called "Invisible Cloth" for experimental purposes. Created a code that effectively removes the red color from the screen, allowing for the customization of the target color. Demonstrated strong proficiency in Python programming, problem-solving, and creative thinking.</p>
        
        <h3>Project 3: Designed Game Ideas</h3>
        <p>Designed and developed a pet game using the concept of linked lists, providing users with interactive pet care and engagement. Implemented features allowing users to feed, play, and interact with their virtual pets. Utilized strong programming skills in implementing data structures. Additionally, an immersive escape game experience with multiple rooms, treasures, and challenges. Crafted a captivating gameplay experience by implementing engaging puzzles and potential hazards. Demonstrated creativity, attention to detail, and the ability to create an enjoyable user experience.
            Created engaging board games featuring unique gameplay scenarios. Enhanced problem-solving and teamwork abilities by implementing innovative coding solutions.</p>
    
        <h3>Project 5: Operating System</h3>
        <p>Worked on simulating operating system processes with an emphasis on scheduling, concurrency, and improving algorithms. Enhanced my C programming and debugging abilities through practical projects.</p>

        <h3>Project 6: Sudoko Game</h3>
        <p>Created and developed a Sudoku solver using Prolog as a way to dive into more complex algorithms and logic programming. This experience helped me deepen my knowledge of functional programming and improve my testing skills.</p>
    
        <h3>Project 7: Pong Game</h3>
        <p>Created a two-player Pong game using Unity, where I wrote C# scripts to bring the gameplay to life. I added a convenient Help Screen and  also features a Quit option through the Escape key, allowing players to exit smoothly. For the UI, I made the most of Unityâ€™s Canvas system to create panels and text for the help screen.</p>
