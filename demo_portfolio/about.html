                <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Idaho. My interest in technology started from a young age, and over the years, I have explored different areas of computing, from programming to database systems. Currently, I work as an SI-PASS leader, where I help students understand complex topics in a collaborative environment. Teaching others not only strengthens my own knowledge but also gives me the opportunity to connect with different people and learn new perspectives. I believe education is a powerful tool that can help anyone grow, and I enjoy being part of that learning journey.</p>

        <p>Outside of my academic work, I enjoy creative activities like drawing and reading. Art has always been a way for me to express ideas and relax, while books help me explore new worlds and gain knowledge. Whether it's fiction, history, or technology-related books, I always find something interesting to learn. I also enjoy crafting, which allows me to create unique things with my hands. These hobbies give me a balance between the technical world of computing and the imaginative world of creativity.</p>
        <p>Over time, I have worked on various projects, ranging from coding experiments to small creative endeavors. In programming, I have explored different languages and technologies, working on things like game development, database design, and problem-solving tasks. I love the challenge of building something functional from scratch and refining it until it works efficiently. Every project teaches me something new, whether it's improving my coding logic, debugging skills, or understanding how users interact with technology.</p>
        <p>One thing I truly value is collaboration. I have worked in different teams, whether in academic settings or personal projects, and I believe that teamwork often leads to the best results. Sharing ideas, solving problems together, and learning from others make projects more meaningful and enjoyable. Working as an SI-PASS leader has further strengthened my ability to communicate complex concepts clearly and help others overcome challenges. I believe that being able to explain something in simple terms is a sign of true understanding.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I am eager to continue learning and growing in both my technical and personal skills. My goal is to keep exploring the world of computing, particularly in database systems and software engineering. At the same time, I want to maintain my creative interests and keep working on projects that blend both technology and creativity. Through this portfolio, I hope to showcase my work, interests, and journey as a student. If youâ€™d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out through the contact page!</p>
